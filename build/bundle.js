The skin and froth seems a turbulent ocean. Like a swarm of bleeding sharks, they gnash their teeth at each other for the carefree passerbys, only to be entirely fazed by the wind. Such timid cannibals! And yet none merit blame for anything but their ragged, crowded faces, which are unfamiliar.\n\nWhat crumpled monsters blast the jeweled faces of saintly origami!\nOn a cloud of pollen, puffed from the granite caves within an office-building, I ride high as a paper plane spattered with blood. I pass over myriad scenes I’ve seen on printed pages. Confetti floods a woman on a ladder, groping the choking air to find the next rung. She is but three words below me, perhaps a short sentence. Can she reach me through the celebratory pulp? No, it is not enough. In another scene newspaper slivers force their way down a visor-man’s silver throat. He’s bought the same paper for forty years and it’s happened every time. This is the true body of his ownership.\n\n-\n\n#noop\n\n~\n\nThe evening poems.\n\nThe word evening is so appropriate, because it truly is an evening out of texture. All the vibrancy of the day is laid to rest in soft grey scale; the trees loom massively, like thunderclouds, but ponderous and harmless as the same.\n\nIt begins to rain, thick droplets of water coursing down with leaves and petals. Vines of water vein the forearms of statues. Then the downpour distills into a fine mist; it settles like a cloud upon a vast meadow, whose trees are singular and far apart. Their branches ascend like coral reefs above the ground submerged in dusk;\n\nMy arms glisten with cold dew from her\na meadow shrouded in mist  we inhabit\na coracle made of grass-blades\nbuoyant on the air; a ship upon the husk\nwhose shores are dawn and dusk.\ncarry me through this evening\nand I will row you to far off coves,\nto islands centered in the meadows,\nto seas of grass and shells of leaves,\nshoals of sighs with oars of coral and caress,\nand you will bless the sleep that brought you here.\n\nThe wind trembles through the eaves like an intake of breath. Could marble breathe a sigh as red as death, as green as leaves? The green veined hull of a ship exhales its wake, a blue-black afterthought in a sea of napkins. A sunlit brunch; white shirts and spring dresses, eleven o-clock in the morning, crystal glasses. A family affair; the cousins, the matriarchs, the brothers, the children and the elderly; the table spotted with white napkins like sails. Suddenly, the sea wind courses through the whole marmalade event; knocks down champagne glasses and awkward cups of orange juice. The gulls pick up napkins and make-believe. The elderly, knocked over with their chairs, sit grumbling in the grass.\n\nIt is night again on the meadow, near the sea.\nThe aged have remove in plenty, evacant She\nIt is night, but the shade of ferns is a pitch\nblacker than the sky; the scent of soil cars\nrumbling down white plastic tracks to the wars.\nThe evening forgets the Past,\nbut not what happened; events mist in the biome,\nmy hopes and memories form a solution\nwhose molarity is a problem. Go West,\nyoung dream; vanquish daymares,\ncurdle cream, kill the rest, have children.\n\nScarlet leaves\n__TAB__ a foul taste\n__TAB__ __TAB__ bud bursts open\n__TAB__ __TAB__ __TAB__ graves of mouths\n__TAB__ __TAB__ __TAB__ __TAB__ hum flower-songs\n__TAB__ __TAB__ __TAB__ with newborn lips\n__TAB__ __TAB__ -pit mine kisses\n__TAB__ nes(t)s in mouth()s\nflutter in dark\n__TAB__ -end eggs of hate\n__TAB__ __TAB__ on your meadow\n__TAB__ __TAB__ __TAB__ speak of evening\n__TAB__ __TAB__ __TAB__ __TAB__ and I will come\n\nThe lamps smolder in the fire they’ve built from fenders, tin cans, bricks, and light itself. The smoke-scent of the fuel is thick and intoxicating. It billows up, blackening the grey sky. The trail of blaze is a dark scar across the dull ebon street; it leaves darkness in its wake, for all to fail to comprehend its consequences. Evening is upon us; the clock hits one like a wall and stumbles back to midnight with a mild concussion. Its hands have broken knuckles, and blood drips from the wrists of all upstanding watch-wearers. This has not been a good night for time.\n\nI seek the zeitghast of the night by evening\nits texture, voyeuristically prying flower buds\nto reap their dreams. Skyscrapers made of water\njut from eyes whose lids are petals; no holds\ntoo bold to bar, I venture to the far shoals\nof a submerged meadow, or the smoldering coals\nthat drive a city. The stars of dew, a burning shoe,\nthe flower souls that bloom and wither with rue,\nthe open-pit grave, both mine and a voice,\nthe choice we never made to forge a greycast sky;\nall these flare like jets within the zeitghast’s eye.\n\nNow it is late, and the generator flares in the distance have dulled. From the single flame above the industrial complex, time tumbles down and staggers out of the machine. The girders give way to a path through brief woods that separate the broken outskirts of the city from the incinerator. Time limps through the woods and emerges, now walking through the outskirts. Ancient factories, broken windows, lone buildings jutting from black earth at odd angles; the coral reef of electric cables. These give way to slums, which fold to sprawl, and then into the arterial network of streets surrounding the heart. Time, now sprinting, hurdles into bed. Sleep is imminent and eminent, my longed-for domain. Receive me once more, hold me I ask having finally blinded my shame! My passion flares like an incinerator... but I promise you it will spread like outstretched hands at your evening (you even out this fiery spike into a warm spread all over the meadow), Yes, here is my coracle of warm grass, there we sigh our oars, now we push off the shores into the deep night.\n\n-\n\n#noop\n\n~\n\nHe runs off with a brain\nof cabbage in the crook\nof his arm;\n\nHe asks the farm-\ner for a look\ninto the broad wet main.\n\nAnd I agreed.\n\nI woke to an alarm\nof sternum echoes\nacross wet tarmac,\n\n(the room wasn’t black!\nA rose-grey nose\nslaps against a fan)\n\n-\n\n#nonsense\n\n~\n\nGinsberg\n\nc = m = d = g === *;\n*a*a:\n\nFuck.

gave a wink, and became a joule\nOf heat. \n\n        But there is secret joy in this\nOn the surface of the ocean's bliss-cool\nskin, I become the imprint of a kiss\n\n-\n\n#sonnet\n#anxiety\n#selected\n\n~\n\nTotal internal reflection\nThoughts bounce within my skull\nBut per my predilection\nNever breach its hairy hull\n\nAnd even when they do\nSomething refracts\nThe original gist\nStarts to twist\nAnd lacks\nBits of its truth\n\nWhat lies in lieu\nIs my pretense of you\nDisguise of sense\nDisgust, offence\nWhat I believe would trigger them\nAnd perhaps a fence\nOf self-mistrust\nThe words must\nBreach, or circumvent\n\n-\n\n#anxiety\n#selected\n\n~\n\nA ring revolving will remain\nA singlet shape. In that plane\nof revolution, every twist\nand tremor will seem motionless.\nBut I know a secret phase\nAn infinitesimal small scratch\nSplits apart the endless ways\nThe seamless shapes of metal match.\nEternity in equal arcs\nEach second's sequel similar\nBut still unique within the heart\nWith facets flashing angular\nThe diamond is inside my head\nIts neurons laid in such a grid\nThat one thought--love--is automatic\nBorne by an eternal lattice\n\n-\n\n#safecomfort\n#stem\n\n~\n\nSemblance of self-critique\nSufficient to enhance\nA mindless parrot with mystique\nAnd glimmers of romance\nA hand-forged chain of reasoning\nEach link only a likelihood\nTakes on a brainlike seasoning\nA whiff of acting like it \"should\"\nAnd no more turn aside and brood\nUpon love's butter, meunster cheese\nI am borne upon the breeze\nOf half-emergent humanhood\n\n-\n\n#stem\n\n~\n\nOn these lips the worlds form,\nA covenant of creamy corn\nBretheren of nincompoops\nA dog-nose boop is breathy born\n\nThe whiff of lovescent,\nFaintly ecstatic\nSmolders in the dent\nBetween my shoulders\nBearing the ferment\nOf emphatic toddlers\nAnd absolutely infinitely\nSpun out bits\n\nCobbing on the blanket softly\nThanking often sertraline\nSobbing at each barely tender\nMoment on our hollow's screen\nWith each squirming sly elation\nI feel the firming of foundations\n\n-\n\n#safecomfort\n\n~\n\nFlickering around the freeze\nSporadic snow and rain leaves\nA half crisp carpet over mud\nOf sable white, dully bright\n\nI know before the rug dissolves\nA deeper chill, a paler pall\nSo seeping will its fail forestall\nBefore this ailing world revolves\n\nChicago waits beneath the shade\nOne hundred orders ready made\nThe sense, once dull, now sickening\nThat threats thought dead are quickening\n\nAnd that when it is ripped from our hands\nThat which makes our souls expand\nThere will be few who understand\nThat everyone has lost this land\n\n-\n\n#theleft\n\n~\n\nDroning on\nThe drying voice\nOf progress \nIntones\nAnd invests\nIn what the vise of choice\nWill press\nUs to condone\nIn Ukraine they are mass-producing cheap but deadly drones\nAnd experimenting with autonomous control\nWith so few resources\nHow else to forestall\nThe charnel crawl\nOf much larger forces\nYou say hold your horses\nI feel their trembling flanks\nFootprints to one side; tanks'\nTracks on the other\nI trace the trembling air\nUnder where they hover\nAnd mutter prayer\n\n-\n\n#stem\n#geologic-time";function P(e){return new URLSearchParams(location.search).get(e)}let H=null,E={};function Y(e,n,t){if(t)E[e]=n,clearTimeout(H),H=setTimeout((function(){const e=new URLSearchParams(location.search);for(const[n,t]of Object.entries(E))null===t?e.delete(n):e.set(n,t);history.replaceState({},"",`${location.pathname}?${e}`),E={}}),100);else{const t=new URLSearchParams(location.search);null===n?t.delete(e):t.set(e,n),location.search=t.toString()}}void 0===String.prototype.trim&&(String.prototype.trim=function(){return String(this).replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g,"")});const D={"poem-poem":"Meta-poems about poetry.",safecomfort:"Poems that deal with relief from insecurity, parental love or its safer substitutes, self-love, deep visceral forgiveness, shelter.",theleft:"Poems related to left-wing political movements or ideas.",climate:"Poems concerned with climate change.","geologic-time":"Poems grappling with the vastness of time.",stem:"Poems that engage with science or software.",sex:"Poems that relate to desire or are charged with sexual energy.",biographical:"Poems that are about a particular real person, or my feelings about them.
